I am Jashanjot. I am a full-stack Web Developer and Software Developer, currently living in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I'm doing BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE from UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA , and my primary focus and inspiration for my studies is Web Development, data analysis & building scalable apps. I am both self-driven and motivated. I am constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am very passionate about Web & Software development, and strive to better myself as a developer, and the development community as a whole.

I have been studying web development extensively and I develop in both C# and PHP, though I primarily use C#. I am experienced in both front and back-end development, and I am proficient in HTML, CSS, LESS, SASS, React, JavaScript, NodeJS, Django, jQuery, AJAX, and SQL/MySQL/PostgreSQL. I am also proficient in many non-web-based languages, including but not limited to Java, C, C++, Python. I have worked on group as well as personal projects, and have used the different languages to create useful tools for data processing, visualizing data, as well as general purpose apps.

I am always working on some projects to keep learning something new (so my brain does not rust üòÅ).

I am open to new projects and the opportunities, CONTACT ME (gilljs5@myumanitoba.ca) if I am good fit for your ideas, and thank you for coming here :)
