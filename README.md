I am an aspiring Software Engineering, currently living in Canada. I'm doing a Bachelor of Science [Honours - Computer Science] at the University of Manitoba.

My primary focus and inspiration for my studies is building scalable software.

I am experienced in both front and back-end development, and I am proficient in React, JavaScript, NodeJS, Django, jQuery, AJAX, and SQL.

I am proficient in many non-web-based languages, including Java, C, C++, and Python.

I regularly take a part in competitive programming contests to meet new like-minded people and improve my knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. I have created programs for data processing and visualizing data, as well as general-purpose apps.

I am open to new opportunities for Summer 2023
